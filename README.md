# Giant Krystal dance

I do **not own** Krystal dance v3 modded, I just **mod** it, I have been approved by SonixDev and i hope u enjoy this or you may even meet me in game and my display is either **ImLazyNoob** Or just **LazyNoob** as it depends on the account im using.

**Also check out Geometry hub as it is underrated right now, it has lots of scripts that are cool! :D**

Heres the link so u can check out the code:
